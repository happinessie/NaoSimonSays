To use Python with Nao, install the following: 
1. Python 2.7, which is available from https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
2. pynaoqi from https://community.aldebaran.com. You have to be signed-in with an account connected to a robot to download it. The installer worked fine on Windows 7. FYI, the python sdk for nao does not work on the most recent version of MacOS (10.11)

I've also been using OpenCV for vision analysis. This requires installing the following for Python. See separate files for installing these packages. 
1. numpy 1.10: available from http://www.numpy.org/. OpenCV will not work if it is an older version of numpy
2. matplotlib: available from http://matplotlib.org/. This is not required, but this lets you display images, which is nice.
3. OpenCV for python, which is available at http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_setup/py_setup_in_windows/py_setup_in_windows.html.
