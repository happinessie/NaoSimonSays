# NaoSimonSays
My Capstone project for a Master's in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. 

Research is being done with NAO robots and children with autism. One activity NAO can play with children that improves their 
listening skills and ability to follow instruction is Simon Says. This program will have NAO play a variation(s) of Simon Says: NAO will give an instruction and use vision analysis to confirm whether its instructions were followed.

This is the first time I have worked with robots or vision analysis.
